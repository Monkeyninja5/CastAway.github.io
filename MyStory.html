<p>The program I hope to achieve will be "CastAway" a one stop shop for all fishing needs.  Included in this program will be types of fish in sections of water that you choose using an overlay on Google Earth, lures that will catch the fish and that are legal in that area, the size limits of each fish, and links to fishing gear websites as well as tutuorial videos for how to use the lures.</p>
	<p>My Father was in the Air Force for 20 years and he retired, during his time in the Air Force he met my Mother who only stayed in for six years.  My parents had my sister and me, and we just kept moving.  As much as I despise moving, I still joined the Air Force and have worked on some of the same aircraft as my Father.</p>
	<p>Having little time with my Father (since he was either deployed or working two other jobs) we only went fishing probably three times in my childhood.  Since I have been stationed in Idaho for the last two years, I decided to do what the locals do, I picked up hunting and fishing.  I never thought these activities could be so much fun, but I have truely grown to love them, even though I am extremely new to them.</p>
	<p>When I was stationed at Mountain Home AFB, I decided to to take in the scenery by doing more outdoorsy stuff (such as fishing and hunting).  I learned from a fellow instructor most of the fishing rules while we were fishing in a lake for Crappie.  One day I decided to fish for trout without my friends guidance since he was needed elsewhere.  I went to a river and assumed all of the rules would be the same there... I was wrong, the river has many more rules due to the species living in it.  Bull Trout are a protected species in the section of river I was fishing, and thats all I knew about that area.  When you fish in an area with protected species you generally need to have barbless hooks in case the protected species bites your lure so you lower the chance of injuring the fish too much.  I went fishing with a barbed treble hook spinner (which means I was not only wrong, I was wrong three times because I had three hooks with barbs), I ended up hooking up with a fish that I thought was a Bull Trout so I took a picture (see pic below) and let it go.  Well I sent that picture to my buddy and he told me everything I was doing wrong and that I could have been fined by Idaho Fish and Game for using that hook in that section of water, oh and also that was a Mountain White Fish and I could have kept it, it is also apparently tasty. </p>
	<p>The rule book for fishing in Idaho is not huge, but you have to look in several different sections to know everything that is legal and illegal to use in certain waters.  Which is when I thought, "there has to be a better way to inform fishermen of these rules!" and so the idea of CastAway was born.</p>
